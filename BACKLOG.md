# BACKLOG — WorthIt.gg

**Purpose:** this file exists to stop things from being built. Every feature idea
lands here instead of in the codebase. Nothing moves from here into the repo
before the case study is published.

**Rules**
1. If an idea arrives mid-build — mine, a user's, or Claude Code's — it gets
   written here and the current task continues.
2. Anything in "Rejected" stays rejected. Re-litigating a rejection costs more
   than the feature is worth.
3. Every entry records *why*. The reasoning is the point, not the list.
4. Entries sourced from real users are marked `[user]` — those are the only ones
   with earned priority after launch.

## Deferred until after launch + case study

| # | Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Custom `.gg` domain | Vercel subdomain converts fine; costs money; zero learning value |
| D2 | Expand catalog beyond ~150 titles | Request queue reveals real demand first; batch quota is the constraint |
| D3 | Automated weekly regeneration (GitHub Actions) | Manual re-run is 20 min; automation is engineering polish, not product evidence |
| D4 | Non-English reviews | Adds translation cost + doubles eval surface for marginal coverage |
| D5 | Steam Deck as a first-class segment | `primarily_steam_deck` exists but playtime segmentation is the thesis; don't dilute it |
| D6 | Hardware-tier grouping (F9) if data density is low | Only ships where ≥15 reviews carry hardware data; otherwise it's noise dressed as insight |
| D7 | "Buy on sale" as a fourth verdict | Open question in PRD §11 — resolve with interview evidence, not intuition |
| D8 | Naming the review-bombing cause in distortion flags | Accuracy risk; test in interviews before shipping |
| D9 | Comparison view (game A vs game B) | Different job-to-be-done; would double the surface area |
| D10 | Shareable verdict images / OG cards | Real distribution value, but post-launch — launch beats polish |

## Rejected — do not build

| # | Item | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Accounts / login / saved history | Friction with zero decision value; PRD non-goal |
| R2 | Monetization of any kind | Changes ToS exposure with Steam; adds nothing to the learning objective |
| R3 | Console / non-Steam platforms | No equivalent open review data source exists |
| R4 | Live on-demand generation per request | Breaks the zero-marginal-cost architecture (decision D1 in PRD §9) |
| R5 | Price tracking, deal alerts, wishlists | Different product entirely |
| R6 | Recommendation engine ("what should I play") | We answer "should I buy X" — narrower question is the wedge |
| R7 | Switching to a paid model to fix hallucination | Wrong diagnosis; grounding checks + self-consistency solve it for free |
| R8 | Database / backend service | Static JSON is the architecture; a DB is unrequested complexity |
| R9 | User-submitted reviews or ratings | Moderation burden, cold-start problem, dilutes the source-of-truth story |

## Open questions (from PRD §11) — resolve with evidence, not building

- Optimal review sample size per title (400? 800?) → tune against eval scores
- Verdict taxonomy sufficiency (see D7)
- Distortion-flag specificity (see D8)
- Minimum hardware-data density for F9 to be trustworthy
- Does the refund cohort deserve visual primacy, or does leading with it read as negative bias?

## Captured during build / launch

*This file is a case-study artifact. What got deferred, and the reasoning for
each, is evidence of prioritisation under constraint — link it from the case
study's decision section.*
